    Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi was an Indian politician and stateswoman who served as the third prime minister of India from 1966 to 1977
     and from 1980 until her assassination in 1984. She was India's first and, to date, only female prime minister and a central 
     figure of the Indian National Congress. Gandhi was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, and 
     the mother of Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded her in office as the country's sixth prime minister.
